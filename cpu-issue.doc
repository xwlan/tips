Q1:
I've identified the high CPU process. Is it possible to debug it?
To retrieve the list of threads, you can use the following script. It shows the stack of each thread of top three high CPU processes:

A1:
for H_PID in $(ps -eo pcpu,pid,ppid,user,args | \
sort -k1 -r | grep -v PID | head -3 | \
awk '{print $2}'); do ps -Llp $H_PID; sudo cat /proc/$H_PID/stack; echo; done
